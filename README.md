# example-semaphore-jekyll-static

This is an example repo that uses [FeaturePeek](https://featurepeek.com) to spin up collaborative feature environments for every pull request.

This particular repo uses:

- the [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com) continuous integration service
- the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static-site generator for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

Check out [more FeaturePeek example repos](https://github.com/featurepeek?utf8=âœ“&q=example&type=&language=) to find out how to integrate with FeaturePeek using different combinations of CI services, front-end frameworks, and container registries.
